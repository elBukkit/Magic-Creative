# Magic-Creative

A set of useful GUIs and spells for a creative-mode island world

Can be used in conjunction with this world generator plugin:

https://github.com/TheBugWhisperer/Minecraft-WaterWorld/releases/tag/1.0

Download the plugin jar and put in your plugins folder as normal. 

Then add the following to your bukkit.yml:

```
worlds:
  world_creative:
    generator: WaterWorld

```

This example also works well with PerWorldInventory:
